# CBHW-W5-Work-Day-Scheduler
Create a simple calendar 

## Description
For our fifth homework assignment, we were tasked to create a day scheduler app using the given HTML and CSS already gigen. We had to use bootstrap, Jquery and formulate a Jscript for the app to work.you are able to type in a text and save it onto the page at any time slot and will even stay when you refresh the page.  Was a lot harder than it sounded but working with a group made it much easier. Also customized it to suit my style. 

*Here is an example of what that page looks like.*
